# React Native Toys

A playground for trying out libraries and challenges in react-native

For example:
 - react-native-skia, and how to blur images
 - setup changes when adding a library, e.g. jestsetup, proguard, babel.config etc 
 - adding mocks to jestsetup for libraries that don't provide mocks

## Why?

I often find myself getting challenged by questions I find online, like "How do I achieve this effect?"
and previously I was making a new project for each challenge, but now I can just add it here.

This saves `node_modules` space and setup time.
